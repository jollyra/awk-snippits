Print the first field of each record in a file
awk -F, '{ print $1 }' < data.csv

String concatination operator is the space.

-F is the Field Separator
-v Var Assignment Flag e.g. -v q="|"

Surround data in bars using Field Sep and Var Flag
awk -F, -v q="|" '{print q $1 q $2 q nl}' data.csv

Get unique values from a column
... | sort | uniq
sort is a prerequisite of uniq which is unfortunate for large data sets

Output the fields in file 2 that are not in file 1 (set difference of column)
awk -F"," '(FNR==NR){a[$3]=1;next}(a[$1] != 1){print $1}' newpopulation_bchydro_20160125164845.csv merged_EM_DM.txt >> accts_not_in_newpopulation.txt

Another way to output the fields in file 2 that are not in file 1 (set difference of column)
comm -32 <(awk '{print $3}' newpopulation_bchydro_20160125164845_noheader.csv | sort   -u) <(awk -F"," '{print $1}' merged_EM_DM.txt | sort -u) >> a.txt
